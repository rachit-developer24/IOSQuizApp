# ❓ Quiz App  

A SwiftUI app that presents a multiple-choice quiz, tracks user progress, and displays results. Built with **MVVM architecture**, it demonstrates state management, conditional rendering, and interactive UI in SwiftUI.

## 🚀 Features
- **MVVM Architecture** – separates UI, state logic, and quiz data  
- **Multiple-Choice Questions** – users can select from different options  
- **Score Tracking** – calculates total score and progress dynamically  
- **State Management** – handles loading, playing, and results states  
- **User Feedback** – shows correct/incorrect answers with real-time updates  
- **SwiftUI UI/UX** – interactive design with clean navigation
